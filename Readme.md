# Fox_CSS
**By: Cameron Varley**

Currently a WIP CSS Framework. I hope to finish this one day.

I built this based on the following CSS Frameworks
1. Bootstrap
2. Bulma
3. UI-Kit

**To Use**
1. clone this git
2. compile scss
3. add main.css to header
4. add necessary javascript to bottom of page (alert, dropdown, j-querry)
